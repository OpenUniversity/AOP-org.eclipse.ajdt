      How can I package my sample code for contribution to the examples plugin?
    </h1>
    <p>
    The org.eclipse.ajdt.examples plugin contains various sample projects which 
    are made available under
    the Examples category of the New wizard, from where they can be imported into 
    your workspace as AspectJ projects.
    It is easy to add new samples to this plugin, as follows:
    <ul>
    	<li>Create a jar file containing your source code, and at least one build c
    	onfiguration file. Place this
    		in the archive folder of the examples plugin.
    	<li>Add an entry to the plugin.xml file for your sample project, by copying 
    	one of the existing entries.
    	<li>Change the src attribute of the import element to refer to your jar 
    	file, and change the title,
    		description, pagetitle, and pagedescription property names as appropriate, and add
    		corresponding entries to the plugin.properties file.
    	<li>Change the build attribute to refer to your default build configuration 
    	file. Your project may contain
    	    more configurations but the one specified here will be the one used to 
    	    initially build the project.
    	<li>Optionally, you can specify an open attribute to the projectsetup element, 
    	which refers to a file,
    	    such as a README file, which is opened after the project has been imported 
    	    to the workspace.   
    </ul>
    </p>
