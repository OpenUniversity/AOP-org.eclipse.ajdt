      How do I setup an AJDT development environment in Eclipse? 
    </h1>

			    <p>There are several stages to this: building AJDT, running the
			    correctness tests, and creating an
			    Eclipse update site. The first two stages are probably sufficient
			    for most purposes.</p>
			
			    <h4>Building AJDT</h4>
			
				<p>Many of the plugins which implement AJDT contain aspects, and so are
				AspectJ projects themselves. This means that you first need to install
				a recent build of AJDT into your development environment from the
				update site or zip file.</p>
							
			    <p>Note also that in order to build AJDT from source you will probably
			    need to increase the memory available to Eclipse. This is
			    typically done by passing something like <code>"-vmargs -Xmx512m"</code> to
			    the Eclipse launcher.</p>
			    			
			    <p>Start with a clean workspace under
			    Eclipse 3.2. Now open the CVS Repository Exploring 
			    perspective. Right-click on the CVS Repositories view, then click "New" > "Repository
			    Location". Host = dev.eclipse.org, Repository path =
			    /cvsroot/tools, Username = anonymous, password should be left
			    blank. Connection type = pserver. Click "Finish".
			    Use the CVS Repositories view to navigate to
			    HEAD/org.eclipse.ajdt/AJDT_src. </p>
			    
			    <p>You now need to switch to the
			    "ajdt1_4" branch in CVS. To discover the branch, you need to
			    right-click on org.eclipse.ajdt and select "Configure Branches
			    and Versions...", and in the dialog that opens navigate to
			    AJDT_src/org.aspect.ajde/.project. Various tags should appear in
			    the right hand side of the dialog. Press "Add Checked Tags", then
			    "OK". Back in the CVS Repositories view you should now be able to
			    navigate to Branches/ajdt1_4/org.eclipse.ajdt/AJDT_src.
			    </p>
			    
			    <p>Select the following projects,
			    right-click and select "Check out" from the context menu:</p>
			 
			    <ul>
			      <li>org.aspectj.ajde,</li>
			      <li>org.aspectj.runtime,</li>
			      <li>org.aspectj.weaver,</li>
			      <li>org.eclipse.ajdt.core,</li>
			      <li>org.eclipse.ajdt.examples,</li>
			      <li>org.eclipse.ajdt.ui,</li>
			      <li>org.eclipse.contribution.visualiser,</li>
			      <li>org.eclipse.contribution.xref.core,</li>
			      <li>org.eclipse.contribution.xref.ui.</li>
			    </ul>
			
			    <p>Eclipse will build the projects as you import them, after
			    which should you be ready to run the plugins inside Eclipse:</p>
			
			   <ul>
			     <li>Switch to the Java Perspective if you're not already in
			     it...</li>
			
			     <li>From the run menu select "Run..."</li>
			
			     <li>Select "Eclipse Application" and click new</li>
			
			     <li>Give your launch configuration a name, and click "Run"</li>
			
			     <li>Subsequent runs can simpy use the launch configuration you
			     just created</li>
			   </ul>
			
			   <h4>Running the correctness tests</h4>
			
			   <p>The next step is to add the test projects. These can be used to
			   verify that everything is okay with your environment and
			   configuration, plus of course to verify the integrity of any
			   changes you might make. Switch back to the CVS perspective and
			   check-out the following projects:</p>
			
			   <ul>
			     <li>org.eclipse.ajdt.core.tests</li>
			     <li>org.eclipse.ajdt.ui.tests</li>
			     <li>org.eclipse.contribution.visualiser.tests</li>
			     <li>org.eclipse.contribution.xref.core.tests</li>
			     <li>org.eclipse.contribution.xref.ui.tests</li>
			   </ul>
			
			   <p>There are two steps to running all of the tests. The
			   first is to run the AJDT core specific tests found in
			   org.eclipse.ajdt.core.tests, and the second is to run
			   the remaining tests.</p>
			
			   <p>To run the AJDT core specific tests expand the
			   org.eclipse.ajdt.core.tests project, then the src folder, then the
			   org.eclipse.ajdt.core.tests package. Now select the AllCoreTests.java file,
			   right-click and select "Run As" &gt; "JUnit Plug-in Test". A new
			   runtime workbench should then be launched and the tests run inside
			   that. Progress and test results can be observed from the JUnit
			   Eclipse view.</p>
			   
			   <p>You can then run all of the remaining tests by expanding the
			   org.eclipse.ajdt.ui.tests project, then the src folder, then the
			   org.eclipse.ajdt.ui.tests package. Now select the AllUITests.java file,
			   right-click and select "Run As" &gt; "JUnit Plug-in Test". A new
			   runtime workbench should then be launched and the tests run inside
			   that. Progress and test results can be observed from the JUnit
			   Eclipse view.</p>
			
			   <p>Now you're ready to start enhancing the plugins by adding to or
			   extending the code in your projects - just use run (or debug) to
			   try out your changes. When you have a patch to submit to the
			   project, go to the "Team" item in the project context menu and
			   select "Create Patch...". Naturally the correctness tests should
			   also be run, and new tests written to accompany fixes or new
			   features.</p>
			
			   <h4>Creating an update site</h4>
			
			   <p>Each of the AJDT plugin projects also contains an Ant build
			   file, "build.xml." The default target builds a packaged version of
			   the project in question. Check-out the "UpdateSite" project from
			   CVS, and use the build.xml file in that project to invoke a master
			   build that builds an entire update site structure in its "dist"
			   directory. To run the build.xml file inside Eclipse, you need to do
			   "Run As > Ant Build..." to bring up the run configuration dialog,
			   then go to the "JRE" tab and choose to run in a separate JRE.</p>
			
			   <p>Those plugins that use aspects in their implementation need
			   to be built using the AspectJ compiler. To do this the
			   "iajc" Ant task is used in each of the relevant build.xml files.
			   For this to run successfully, it needs to be able to locate
			   the org.aspectj.ajde and org.aspectj.weaver plugins from the
			   installed version of AJDT. Each build.xml file refers to the
			   specific version on AJDT installed on the build machine, so unless
			   you have exactly the same version installed, you need to uncomment
			   and override the "aspectj.plugin.home" and "aspectj.weaver.home"
			   properties in the build.xml file from the "UpdateSite" project.</p>
