        easy to use as possibe. The load-time weaving mechanism is chosen through JVM startup options. 
        Configuration files determine the set of aspects to be used for weaving and which 
        types will be woven. Additional diagnostic options allow the user to debug the configuration and 
        weaving process. </p><div class="sect2"><a name="enabling-load-time-weaving"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="enabling-load-time-weaving"></a>Enabling Load-time Weaving</h3></div></div><p> AspectJ 5 supports several different ways of enabling load-time weaving for

                            are execution environment dependent. Configuration for the supported environments is discussed
                            later in this chapter.</p><p>

                files located on the class loader search path. Each file may define a list of
                concrete aspects to be used for weaving, type patterns describing which types
                should woven, and a set of options to be passed to the weaver. In addition AspectJ 5
                supports the definition of concrete aspects in XML. Aspects defined in this way
                must extend an abstract aspect visible to the weaver. The abstract aspect
                may define abstract pointcuts (but not abstract
                methods). The following example shows a simple aop.xml file: </p><pre class="programlisting">
          &lt;aspectj&gt;

            &lt;aspects&gt;
              &lt;!-- declare two existing aspects to the weaver --&gt;
              &lt;aspect name="com.MyAspect"/&gt;
              &lt;aspect name="com.MyAspect.Inner"/&gt;

              &lt;!-- define a concrete aspect inline --&gt;
              &lt;concrete-aspect name="com.xyz.tracing.MyTracing" extends="tracing.AbstractTracing"&gt;
                &lt;pointcut name="tracingScope" expression="within(org.maw.*)"/&gt;
              &lt;/concrete-aspect&gt;

              &lt;!-- Of the set of aspects known to the weaver, use aspects matching
                   the type pattern "com..*" for weaving. --&gt;
              &lt;include within="com..*"/&gt;

              &lt;!-- Do not use any aspects with the @CoolAspect annotation for weaving --&gt;
              &lt;exclude within="@CoolAspect *"/&gt;

            &lt;/aspects&gt;

            &lt;weaver options="-verbose -XlazyTjp"&gt;
              &lt;!-- Weave types that are within the javax.* or org.aspectj.*
                   packages. Also weave all types in the foo package that do
                   not have the @NoWeave annotation. --&gt;
              &lt;include within="javax.*"/&gt;
              &lt;include within="org.aspectj.*"/&gt;
              &lt;include within="(!@NoWeave foo.*) AND foo.*"/&gt;
              &lt;dump within="somepack.*"/&gt;&lt;!-- will dump weaved classes to the "./_ajdump" folder on disk (for diagnostic purpose) --&gt;
            &lt;/weaver&gt;

          &lt;/aspectj&gt;

		  </pre><p>
                An aop.xml file contains two key sections: "aspects" defines one
                or more aspects to the weaver and controls which aspects are to be
                used in the weaving process; "weaver" defines weaver options and which
                types should be woven.
            </p><p>
                The simplest way to define an aspect to the weaver is to 
                specify the fully-qualified name of the aspect type in an aspect element. 
                You can also
                declare (and define to the weaver) aspects inline in the aop.xml file.
                This is done using the "concrete-aspect" element. A concrete-aspect
                declaration must provide a pointcut definition for every abstract 
                pointcut in the abstract aspect it extends. This mechanism is a 
                useful way of externalizing configuration for infrastructure and
                auxiliary aspects where the pointcut definitions themselves can be
                considered part of the configuration of the service.
            </p><p>
                <span class="emphasis"><i>
                Note: concrete-aspect is not available in AspectJ 1.5 M3.
                </i></span>
            </p><p>
                The aspects element may optionally contain one or more include and
                exclude elements (by default, all defined aspects are used for weaving).
                Specifying include or exclude elements restricts the set of defined
                aspects to be used for weaving to those that are matched by an include
                pattern, but not by an exclude pattern. The 'within' attribute accepts
                a type pattern of the same form as a within pcd, except that &amp;&amp;
                and || are replaced by 'AND' and 'OR'.
            </p><p>
                The weaver element is used to pass options to the weaver and to specify
                the set of types that should be woven. If no include elements are specified
                then all types seen by the weaver will be woven.
            </p><p> When several configuration files are visible from a given weaving class loader
                their contents are conceptually merged (this applies to both aop.xml files
                and to aop.properties files as described in the next section). 
                The files are merged in the order they are
                found on the search path (regular <tt>getResourceAsStream</tt> lookup)
                according to the following rules: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><a name="d0e4248"></a> The set of available aspects is the set of all
                    declared and defined aspects (<tt>aspect</tt> and
                    <tt>concrete-aspect</tt> elements of the <tt>aspects</tt>
                    section).</li><li><a name="d0e4259"></a>The set of aspects used for weaving is the subset of the available
                    aspects that are matched by at least one include statement and are not matched
                    by any exclude statements. If there are no include statements then all non-excluded
                    aspects are included.</li><li><a name="d0e4261"></a> The set of types to be woven are those types matched by at
                    least one weaver <tt>include</tt> element and not matched by any 
                    weaver <tt>exclude</tt> element. If there are no weaver include
                    statements then all non-excluded types are included.</li><li><a name="d0e4269"></a> The weaver options are derived by taking the union of the
                    options specified in each of the weaver options attribute specifications. Where an
                    option takes a value e.g. <tt>-warn:none</tt> the most recently defined value
                    will be used.</li></ul></div><p>It is not an error for the same aspect to be defined to the weaver in 
                more than one visible <tt>META-INF/aop.xml</tt> file. 
                However, if a declarative concrete aspect
                is declared in more than aop.xml file then an error will be issued.
                 A concrete aspect 
                defined in this way will be used to weave types loaded by the
                class loader that loaded the aop.xml file in which it was defined.
