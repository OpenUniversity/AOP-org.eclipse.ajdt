<h1>AspectJ 5 Readme</h1>

<p>AspectJ 5 introduces several important changes to the language and tools
in order to support Java 5, and to extend the capabilities of AspectJ in
general. These changes are too extensive to describe in a simple readme file,
so instead we have created the <a href="adk15notebook/index.html">AspectJ 5
Developer's Notebook</a> to describe them.</p>

<p>The 1.5.0 M1 milestone release supports a subset of the changes described
in the developer's notebook. Currently implemented features are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="adk15notebook/varargs.html">Varargs</a>
  <li><a href="adk15notebook/enumeratedtypes.html">Enums</a>
  <li><a href="adk15notebook/covariance.html">Covariance</a>
  <li><a href="adk15notebook/annotations.html">Annotations</a>, with the following
  exceptions: declare annotation is not yet implemented, and the @pcd forms
  can be used for matching, but not yet for binding of formals.
  <li><a href="adk15notebook/autoboxing.html">Autoboxing</a>
  <li>Bridge methods created by Java compilers to support generics are treated
  as synthetic and have no join points.
</ul>

<p>These are implemented as changes to the weaver, not the front-end compiler.
The 1.5.0 M1 release cannot be used to <i>compile</i> code using Java 5 
features, but can be used to weave (inpath) Java classes created by a Java 5
compiler.</p>

<p>For information on bug fixes in AspectJ 5 v1.5.0, see the <a href="changes.html">
changes</a> document.</p>
