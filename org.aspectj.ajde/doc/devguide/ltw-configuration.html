                files located on the class loader search path. Each file may define a list of
                concrete aspects to be used for weaving, type patterns describing which types
                should woven, and a set of options to be passed to the weaver. In addition AspectJ 5
                supports the definition of concrete aspects in XML. Aspects defined in this way
                must extend an abstract aspect visible to the weaver. The abstract aspect
                may define abstract pointcuts (but not abstract
                methods). The following example shows a simple aop.xml file: </p><pre class="programlisting">
          &lt;aspectj&gt;

            &lt;aspects&gt;
              &lt;!-- declare two existing aspects to the weaver --&gt;
              &lt;aspect name="com.MyAspect"/&gt;

              &lt;!-- define a concrete aspect inline --&gt;
              &lt;concrete-aspect name="com.xyz.tracing.MyTracing"
                               extends="tracing.AbstractTracing"
                               precedence="com.xyz.first, *"&gt;
                &lt;pointcut name="tracingScope" expression="within(org.maw.*)"/&gt;
              &lt;/concrete-aspect&gt;

              &lt;!-- Of the set of aspects declared in this sole aop.xml,
                   use aspects matching the type pattern "com..*" for weaving. --&gt;
              &lt;include within="com..*"/&gt;

              &lt;!-- Of the set of aspects declared in this sole aop.xml,
                   do not use any aspects with the @CoolAspect annotation for weaving --&gt;

              &lt;include within="javax.*"/&gt;

              &lt;dump within="somepack.*"/&gt;&lt;!-- will dump weaved classes to the "./_ajdump" folder on disk (for diagnostic purpose) --&gt;
            &lt;/weaver&gt;

          &lt;/aspectj&gt;

		  </pre><p>
                An aop.xml file contains two key sections: "aspects" defines one
                or more aspects to the weaver and controls which aspects are to be
                used in the weaving process; "weaver" defines weaver options and which
                types should be woven.
            </p><p>
                The simplest way to define an aspect to the weaver is to 
                specify the fully-qualified name of the aspect type in an aspect element. 
                You can also
                declare (and define to the weaver) aspects inline in the aop.xml file.
                This is done using the "concrete-aspect" element. A concrete-aspect
                declaration must provide a pointcut definition for every abstract 
                pointcut in the abstract aspect it extends. This mechanism is a 
                useful way of externalizing configuration for infrastructure and
                auxiliary aspects where the pointcut definitions themselves can be
                considered part of the configuration of the service.
                Refer to the next section for more details.
            </p><p>
                The <tt>aspects</tt> element may optionally contain one or more <tt>include</tt> and
                <tt>exclude</tt> elements (by default, all defined aspects are used for weaving).
                Specifying include or exclude elements restricts the set of defined
                aspects to be used for weaving to those that are matched by an include
                pattern, but not by an exclude pattern. The <tt>within</tt> attribute accepts
                a type pattern of the same form as a within pcd, except that &amp;&amp;
                and || are replaced by 'AND' and 'OR'.
            </p><p>
                Note that <tt>include</tt> and <tt>exclude</tt> affects the declared list of aspects (or concrete-aspect) defined in this
                sole aop.xml and has no side effect on other aop.xml files.
                Also note it is required to use <tt>aspect</tt> or <tt>concrete-aspect</tt> elements and that include does not
                mean "pick any aspect you 'll find" - as the aspect list must be known by the weaver.
            </p><p>
                The weaver element is used to pass options to the weaver and to specify
                the set of types that should be woven. If no include elements are specified
                then all types seen by the weaver will be woven.
            </p><p> When several configuration files are visible from a given weaving class loader
                their contents are conceptually merged (this applies to both aop.xml files
                and to aop.properties files as described in the next section). 
                The files are merged in the order they are
                found on the search path (regular <tt>getResourceAsStream</tt> lookup)
                according to the following rules: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p><a name="d0e2868"></a>The set of available aspects is the set of all
                    declared and defined aspects (<tt>aspect</tt> and

                    section).</p></li><li><p><a name="d0e2880"></a>The set of aspects used for weaving is the subset of the available
                    aspects that are matched by at least one include statement and are not matched

                    aspects are included.</p></li><li><p><a name="d0e2883"></a> The set of types to be woven are those types matched by at
                    least one weaver <tt>include</tt> element and not matched by any

                    statements then all non-excluded types are included.</p></li><li><p><a name="d0e2892"></a> The weaver options are derived by taking the union of the
                    options specified in each of the weaver options attribute specifications. Where an
                    option takes a value e.g. <tt>-warn:none</tt> the most recently defined value
                    will be used.</p></li></ul></div><p>It is not an error for the same aspect to be defined to the weaver in 
                more than one visible <tt>META-INF/aop.xml</tt> file. 
                However, if a declarative concrete aspect
                is declared in more than aop.xml file then an error will be issued.
                 A concrete aspect 
                defined in this way will be used to weave types loaded by the
                class loader that loaded the aop.xml file in which it was defined. 
                </p><p> A <tt>META-INF/aop.xml</tt> file will automatically be generated when
                using the <tt>-outjar</tt> option of the AspectJ compiler. 
                It will simply contain a (possibly empty) set of aspect elements, one for
                each concrete aspect included in the JAR. </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="concrete-aspect"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="concrete-aspect"></a>Using Concrete Aspects</h3></div></div><p>
                It is possible to concretize an abstract aspect by the mean of the <tt>META-INF/aop.xml</tt>
                file. This is usefull to define abstract pointcuts at deployment time, and also gives control
                over precedence through the <tt>precedence</tt> attribute of the
                <tt>concrete-aspect</tt> XML element.
                Consider the following:
            </p><pre class="programlisting">
            package mypack;

            @Aspect
            public abstract class AbstractAspect {

                // abstract pointcut: no expression is defined
                @Pointcut
                abstract void scope();

                @Before("scope() &amp;&amp; execution(* *..doSome(..))")
                public void before(JoinPoint jp) {
                   ....
                }
            }
            </pre><p>
                This aspect is equivalent to the following in code style:
            </p><pre class="programlisting">
            package mypack;

            public abstract aspect AbstractAspect {

                // abstract pointcut: no expression is defined
                abstract pointcut scope();

                before() : scope() &amp;&amp; execution(* *..doSome(..)) {
                   ....
                }
            }
            </pre><p>
                This aspect (in either of its style) is a good candidate for concretization through <tt>META-INF/aop.xml</tt>.
                It defines the abstract pointcut <tt>within()</tt>. It is important to remember that
                concretization in this case must obey to the following rules:
                <div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p><a name="d0e2940"></a>The parent aspect must be abstract. It can be an @AspectJ or a
                            regular code style aspect.</p></li><li><p><a name="d0e2943"></a>Only simple abstract pointcut can be concretized ie pointcut that don't expose
                            state (through <tt>args(), this(), target(), if()</tt>). In @AspectJ syntax
                            as illustrated in this sample, this means the method that hosts the pointcut is abstract,
                            has no arguments, and returns void.</p></li><li><p><a name="d0e2949"></a>Concretization must defines all such abstract pointcuts ie it is not possible
                            to have <tt>concrete-aspect</tt> inter dependancies.</p></li><li><p><a name="d0e2955"></a>Concretization can only concretize pointcuts ie there cannot be abstract method
                            left in the aspect.</p></li></ul></div>
                If you have requirements for more complex aspect inheritance, you should consider regular aspect
                inheritance instead of concretization through XML.
                Given that the following XML is valid:
            </p><pre class="programlisting">
            &lt;aspectj&gt;
                &lt;conrete-aspect name="mypack.__My__AbstractAspect" extends="mypack.AbstractAspect"&gt;
                    &lt;pointcut name="scope" expression="within(yourpackage..*)"/&gt;
                &lt;/concrete-aspect&gt;
            &lt;/aspectj&gt;
            </pre><p>
                It is important to remember that the <tt>name</tt> attribute in the XML directive
                <tt>concrete-aspect</tt> defines the fully qualified name that will be given to the
                concrete aspect. It must then be a valid class name. This one will indeed be generated on the fly by the weaver internals. You must
                then ensure that there won't be name collision. Also note that the concrete aspect will be
                defined at the classloader level for which the aop.xml is visible. This implies that if you need
                to use the <tt>aspectof</tt> methods to access the aspect instance(s) (depending on the perclause
                of the aspect it extends) you have to use the helper API <tt>org.aspectj.lang.Aspects.aspectOf(..)</tt>
                as in:
            </p><pre class="programlisting">
                // exception handling omitted
                Class myConcreteAspectClass = Class.forName("mypack.__My__AbstractAspect");

                // here we are using a singleton aspect
                AbstractAspect concreteInstance = Aspects.aspectOf(myConcreteAspectClass);
            </pre></div><div class="sect2"><a name="concrete-aspect-precedence"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="concrete-aspect-precedence"></a>Using Concrete Aspects to define precedence</h3></div></div><p>
                As described in the previous section, the <tt>concrete-aspect</tt> element in
                <tt>META-INF/aop.xml</tt> gives the option to declare the precedence, just as
                <tt>@DeclarePrecedence</tt> or <tt>declare precedence</tt> do in
                aspect source code.
            </p><p>
                Sometimes it is required to declare precedence without extending any abstract aspect
                as well. For such a need, it is possible to use the <tt>concrete-aspect</tt>
                element without the <tt>extends</tt> attribute and without any
                <tt>pointcut</tt> nested element, but only with a <tt>precedence</tt>
                attribute.
                Consider the following:
            </p><pre class="programlisting">
                &lt;aspectj&gt;
                    &lt;concrete-aspect name="mypack.__MyDeclarePrecedence"
                                     precedence="*..*Security*, Logging+, *"/&gt;
                &lt;/aspectj&gt;
            </pre><p>
                This deployment time declaration is only defining a precedence rule. You have to remember
                that the <tt>name</tt> attribute must be a valid fully qualified class name
                that will be then reserved for this concrete-aspect and must not conflict with other classes
                you deploy.

                            You must also be very cautious about using a custom handler since it is likely that it will be invoked
                            (as well as all its third parties) while the weaving is done, which means that f.e. it cannot be weaved
                            by the aspects that are configured within the same deployment unit.
