/**
 * A cross reference where calculating the set of associates is an
 * expensive operation. The <code>IRunnableWithProgress.run()</code> 
 * operation will be called at a client's (often end-user's) request.
 * <p>
 * The set of associates for this cross reference should be evaluated in
 * the body of the run method. After run has been called, getAssociates() 
 * should return the results of the evaluation. These results should be retained
 * (made available through subsequent calls to getAssociates)
 * until such time as evaluate is called again, whereupon the
 * result set should be updated once more. 
 * <p>Implementors may return a non-null empty iterator from getAssociates()
 * before the first call to run.</p>
