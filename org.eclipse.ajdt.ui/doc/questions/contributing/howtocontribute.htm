      How can I contribute to the AJDT project?
    </h1>
    <p>
    Your contributions to the AJDT project are strongly welcomed! You can create a 
    patch that fixes a bug or provides an enhancement and submit
	it to the AJDT developers either as an attachment to a bug in Bugzilla, or as an 
	attachment to a post to the newsgroup or developer mailing list.
    You can also contribute sample code showing interesting uses of AspectJ, by adding 
    entries to the example plugin.
	All contributions must be made available under the 
	<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/termsofuse.php">terms of the Eclipse website</a> see
	the Eclipse 
	<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/legalfaq.php#contributions">contribution and participation FAQ</a>. Sorry, but for legal reasons
	we are unable to accept patches emailed directly to developers, and will
	 normally ask you to resubmit these either via Bugzilla or the mailing list.
	<p>AJDT development is run as a meritocracy, developers who have a track 
	record of submitting good patches can become committers on the project.
