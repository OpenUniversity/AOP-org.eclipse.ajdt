      Can I still use Clover to gather code coverage statistics when I'm using AspectJ?
    </h1>
    <p>
	 Yes, you can still use Clover to gather code coverage
	 statistics for your java code when you use AspectJ. You are, however, unable
	 to collect coverage information for your aspects. 
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 To enable an AspectJ project
	 to be ready to collect coverage information you need to add the Clover
	 builder to the list of builders for that project. At the time of writing you
	 can either:
	 <ul>
	 <li>Remove the AspectJ Nature, compile the project with Clover
	     from the Clover View, and then convert the project back to
	     an AspectJ project, or </li>
	 <li>Add the Clover builder directly to the list of builders in
	     the .project file of your AspectJ project. 
	 </li>    
	 </ul>
	 </p>
	<p> 
	 Your project setup affects whether or not your aspects are invoked,
	 however, in all cases the coverage information for your java classes
	 is collected.
    </p>  
    
    <h4>Aspects are in the same project as the application</h4>
    
    <p>
    In this case, the aspects are woven into the application and cross cutting
    information is shown in the gutter markers and Cross References view.
    Moreover, it is the application project which needs to be built with
    the Clover builder. When the tests are run, coverage information appears
    in the Clover view for the application project, however, the aspects are not 
    invoked. 
    </p>     

    <h4>Aspects are in a separate project</h4>
    
    <p>
    In this case, the application code is a java project which is compiled
    with Clover. The aspects are in a separate AspectJ project which is
    also compiled with Clover. The tests are in a separate project which 
    depends on the AspectJ one. When the tests are run, coverage information
    appears in the Clover view for the application project as well as the 
    AspectJ project. In this case the aspects are invoked.
