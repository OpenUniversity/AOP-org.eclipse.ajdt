      While aspects define types that crosscut, the AspectJ system does not
      allow completely arbitrary crosscutting. Rather, aspects define types
      that cut across principled points in a program's execution. These
      principled points are called join points.
    </p><p>
      A join point is a well-defined point in the execution of a
      program. The join points defined by AspectJ are:
    </p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><a name="d0e4516"></a><span class="term">Method call</span></dt><dd>
          When a method is called, not including super calls of
          non-static methods.
        </dd><dt><a name="d0e4521"></a><span class="term">Method execution</span></dt><dd>
          When the body of code for an actual method executes.
        </dd><dt><a name="d0e4526"></a><span class="term">Constructor call</span></dt><dd>
          When an object is built and that object's initial constructor is
          called (i.e., not for "super" or "this" constructor calls).  The
          object being constructed is returned at a constructor call join
          point, so its return type is considered to be the type of the
          object, and the object itself may be accessed with <tt>after
          returning</tt> advice.
        </dd><dt><a name="d0e4534"></a><span class="term">Constructor execution</span></dt><dd>
          When the body of code for an actual constructor executes, after
          its this or super constructor call.  The object being constructed
          is the currently executing object, and so may be accessed with
          the <tt>this</tt> pointcut.  The constructor execution
          join point for a constructor that calls a super constructor also
          includes any non-static initializers of enclosing class.  No
          value is returned from a constructor execution join point, so its
          return type is considered to be void.
        </dd><dt><a name="d0e4542"></a><span class="term">Static initializer execution</span></dt><dd>
          When the static initializer for a class executes.  No value is
          returned from a static initializer execution join point, so its
          return type is considered to be void.
        </dd><dt><a name="d0e4547"></a><span class="term">Object pre-initialization</span></dt><dd>
         Before the object initialization code for a particular class runs.
         This encompasses the time between the start of its first called
         constructor and the start of its parent's constructor.  Thus, the
         execution of these join points encompass the join points of the
         evaluation of the arguments of <tt>this()</tt> and
         <tt>super()</tt> constructor calls.  No value is
         returned from an object pre-initialization join point, so its
         return type is considered to be void.
       </dd><dt><a name="d0e4558"></a><span class="term">Object initialization</span></dt><dd>
          When the object initialization code for a particular class runs.
          This encompasses the time between the return of its parent's
          constructor and the return of its first called constructor. It
          includes all the dynamic initializers and constructors used to
          create the object.  The object being constructed is the currently
          executing object, and so may be accessed with the
          <tt>this</tt> pointcut.  No value is returned from a
          constructor execution join point, so its return type is
          considered to be void.
        </dd><dt><a name="d0e4566"></a><span class="term">Field reference</span></dt><dd>
          When a non-constant field is referenced.  [Note that references
          to constant fields (static final fields bound to a constant
          string object or primitive value) are not join points, since Java
          requires them to be inlined.]
        </dd><dt><a name="d0e4571"></a><span class="term">Field set</span></dt><dd>
          When a field is assigned to.
          Field set join points are considered to have one argument,
          the value the field is being set to.
          No value is returned from a field set join point, so
          its return type is considered to be void.
          [Note that the initializations of constant fields (static
          final fields where the initializer is a constant string object or
          primitive value) are not join points, since Java requires their
          references to be inlined.]
        </dd><dt><a name="d0e4576"></a><span class="term">Handler execution</span></dt><dd>
          When an exception handler executes.
          Handler execution join points are considered to have one argument,
          the exception being handled.
          No value is returned from a field set join point, so
          its return type is considered to be void.
        </dd><dt><a name="d0e4581"></a><span class="term">Advice execution</span></dt><dd>
          When the body of code for a piece of advice executes.
