      AspectJ views
    </h1>
    <p>The AspectJ development tools contribute the following views to the workbench:</p>

    <h2>Cross References view</h2>

	<p>The Cross References view shows crosscutting relationships for the currently selected
	Java or AspectJ element.  The view responds to selections made in either the editor
	or the outline view.</p>

    <h2>Crosscutting Comparison view</h2>

	<p>The Crosscutting Comparison view shows the results of comparing the crosscutting
	relationships present in two different versions of a project, or between
	two advice or declare elements in a project.</p>

    <h2>AJDT Event Trace view</h2>
    
    <p>The AJDT Event Trace view displays information
    about AJDT events, such as builds, errors and other tasks. It is mainly used for debugging and to help
    diagnose users' problems.</p>
