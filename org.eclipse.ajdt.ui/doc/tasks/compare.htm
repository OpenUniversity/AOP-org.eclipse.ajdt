      Comparing crosscutting
    </h1>
    <p>
      If you change the pointcut associated with some advice, you may change the
      locations the advice affects. Similiarly if you add a new method, it may
      become advised by existing advice, or if you rename a method or change its
      signature, advice that was previously affecting it may no longer match. You
      can use the editor markers and Cross References view to detect
      these events. But given larger projects, or a large number of changes, it
      becomes impractical to record and then compare every single crosscutting
      relationship in a project before and after every change.

    <p>
      This is where the crosscutting comparison functionality in AJDT comes in.
      The list of crosscutting relationships in an AspectJ project can be saved
      out into a file, for a known reference state of the project. The relationships
      in this file can then be compared with a later version of the project, or with
      a crosscutting file that was created at a different time.
