      Visualizing the affects of your aspects in a project
    </h1>
    <p>
      To visualize the affects of your aspects in a project, open the Aspect Visualization 
      perspective and select the required project in the <b>Projects</b> view (which is located at 
      the far left of the Aspect Visualization perspective). The classes and aspects contained
      within the selected project are represented as bars in the Visualiser view, with
      <ul>
      <li>stripes representing the places where aspects are affecting the code, with the
          different colors representing the different aspects. To find out which color
          represents which aspect, look in the Visualiser Menu view in the far right
          of the Aspect Visualization perspective and</li>
      <li>filled in bars representing classes and aspects which are not affected by
          any aspects. To filter these out from the view click the <b>Limit visualiation
          to affected bars</b> button in the Visualiser toolbar.</li>
      </ul>
      You can choose which aspects to visualize by checking/unchecking the box next
      to the required/nonrequired aspect in the Visualiser Menu.
