      Saving crosscutting information
    </h1>
    <p>
      In order to compare the crosscutting information between different versions
      of a project, you first need to save out the crosscutting information
      from the current build into a file. This crosscutting information includes
      details of those locations in the code for a project that are being affected
      by advice or inter-type declarations. 
    </p>
    <p>To save the crosscutting information for a project:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select the project in the Package Explorer.</li>
      <li>Right click and select <b>AspectJ Tools &gt; Saving Crosscutting Map...</b>
          from the context menu.</li>
      <li>Enter a name for the crosscutting map file in the dialog, and click
          <b>OK</b>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
       A file is then created in the project and the crosscutting information
       is written to it in binary form. Crosscutting map files have an
       extension of ".ajmap" and as many such files as required can be created
       for different versions or configurations of the project. These files then
       serve as the basis for comparison, either with each other or with the
       current build.
