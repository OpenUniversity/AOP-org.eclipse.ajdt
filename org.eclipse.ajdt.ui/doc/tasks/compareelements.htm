    <h1>
      Comparing two elements
    </h1>
    <p>
      To compare the crosscutting of two advice or two declare elements, or one of each:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select the two elements in the Outline View or Package Explorer.</li>
      <li>Right click and select <b>Compare Crosscutting With
          &gt; Each Other.</b>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
       The results of the comparison are then shown in the 
       <b>Crosscutting Comparison</b> view, which is opened in the current
       perspective if it is not already showing.
    </p>
    
    <p>
       The <b>Propagate Up</b> toggle button can be used to adjust the granularity of
       the comparison. By default the comparison is exact - the join points
       affected by each element must match. When the toggle is selected, all
       join points which occur within methods (calls made within the method, or catch
       blocks for example) are propagated up to the enclosing method, and the
       comparison is then performed between those methods.
