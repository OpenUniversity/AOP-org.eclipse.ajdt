      Comparing two builds
    </h1>
    <p>
      To compare two crosscutting map files:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select two files with the ".ajmap" extension in the Package Explorer.</li>
      <li>Right click and select <b>AspectJ Tools &gt; Compare Crosscutting With
          Each Other.</b>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
       The results of the comparison are then shown in the 
       <b>Crosscutting Comparison</b> view, which is opened in the current
       perspective if it was not already showing.
    </p>
    
    <p>
       The older crosscutting map file is compared with the newer one, and the
       results are displayed in a table. The first column indicates whether
       a given crosscutting relationship has been added or removed, i.e. whether it
       exists in the newer map but not the older one, or vice versa. The remaining
       three columns show the source element, name of the relationship, and target
       element respectively. The cells of the table can be navigated with the
       keyboard or mouse. Selecting a table cell containing a source or target element
       causes that element to be opened in the editor (except where that element
       is one which no longer exists).
