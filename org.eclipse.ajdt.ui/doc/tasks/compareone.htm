      Comparing with the current build
    </h1>
    <p>
      Once you have a ".ajmap" file containing crosscutting
      information for a particular version or configuration of a project,
      you can compare it against the crosscutting present in the
      current build.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select a file with the ".ajmap" extension in the Package Explorer.</li>
      <li>Right click and select <b>AspectJ Tools &gt; Compare Crosscutting With
          Current Build.</b>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
       The results of the comparison are then shown in the 
       <b>Crosscutting Comparison</b> view, which is opened in the current
       perspective if it is not already showing.
    </p>
    
    <p>
       The crosscutting map file is compared with the crosscutting present
       in the current build, and the
       results are displayed in a table. The first column indicates whether
       a given crosscutting relationship has been added or removed, i.e. whether it
       exists in the current build but not in the map file, or vice versa. The remaining
       three columns show the source element, name of the relationship, and target
       element respectively. The cells of the table can be navigated with the
       keyboard or mouse. Selecting a table cell containing a source or target element
       causes that element to be opened in the editor (except where that element
       is one which no longer exists).
    </p>
    
    <p>
       Whenever a full or incremental build of the project occurs the crosscutting
       information may change. To keep the crosscutting comparison results up to date,
       the comparison is redone automatically. This provides an ongoing view of
       how the crosscutting relationships present in a project are changing in
       response to code changes in the project, such as during refactoring.
