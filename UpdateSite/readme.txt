This archive contains the AJDT feature as a feature plugin and set of
standard plugins.  It should be used by anyone who cannot make use of the
update site for AJDT.

To install it, please unzip it in your eclipse install directory (the same
directory in which you can find eclipse.exe) - it will correctly place the various
components in the right directories below this install directory and next time
you start Eclipse, you will have AJDT.
