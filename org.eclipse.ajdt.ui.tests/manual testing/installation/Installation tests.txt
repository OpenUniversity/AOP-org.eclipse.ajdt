Installation Testing
--------------------

The scenarios which need to be tested are:

(1) Install into a clean eclipse via update site (INSTALL_1)
(2) Install into a clean eclipse using a zip file (INSTALL_2)
(3) Upgrade from 1.1.12 via update site (INSTALL_3)
(4) Upgrade from 1.1.12 via zip file (INSTALL_4)
(5) Upgrade from 1.1.12 via Automatic Updates (under preferences > install/update) (INSTALL_5)
(6) Upgrade from the latest 1.2.0 Milestone
(7) Try to install on eclipse 2.1 via update site --> expect this to not let you install AJDT
    and gives an error saying require a 3.0.0 version of one of the eclipse plugins) (INSTALL_6)
(8) Install on latest eclipse 3.0.1 build via update site --> this should install, just don't know
    how it will behave once installed (!) (INSTALL_7)
(9) Install on latest eclipse 3.1 build via update site --> this should install, just don't know
    how it will behave once installed (!)   (INSTALL_8)
