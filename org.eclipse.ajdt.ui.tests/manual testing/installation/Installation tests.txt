Installation Testing
--------------------

The scenarios which need to be tested are:

(1) Install into a clean eclipse via update site
(2) Install into a clean eclipse using a zip file
(3) Upgrade from 1.1.11 via update site
(4) Upgrade from 1.1.11 via zip file
(5) Upgrade from 1.1.11 via Automatic Updates (under preferences > install/update)
(6) Upgrade from 1.1.10
(7) Try to install on eclipse 2.1 via update site --> expect this to not let you install AJDT
    and gives an error saying require a 3.0.0 version of one of the eclipse plugins)
(8) Install on latest eclipse 3.0.1 build via update site --> this should install, just don't know
    how it will behave once installed (!)
(9) Install on latest eclipse 3.1 build via update site --> this should install, just don't know
    how it will behave once installed (!)  


Things to check in each installation:
