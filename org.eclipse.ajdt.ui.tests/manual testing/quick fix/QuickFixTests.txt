===========================

Test 1
------
Checkout the QuickFix test project.

Open TestJava.java in the AspectJ editor (Right Click > Open With > AspectJ/Java Editor).

It should contain one warning and one error, with a light bulb gutter annotation
for each. (QFIX_1)

The code causing the warning and error should be underlined in red and yellow
respectively. (QFIX_2)

Test that suitable quick fixes are available for both the warning and the error by: (QFIX_3)
  - Right-click the gutter annotation and select "Quick Fix" from the context menu
  - Putting the cursor somewhere in the error/warning and pressing Ctrl-1
  - Clicking on the light bulb

  
Test 2

Repeat the above in the TestAspect.java file, but the results should be as follows:

  - light bulbs markers appears, but no completions are available. (QFIX_4)
  
Test 3
------

  - no light bulbs are present, just the standard error and warning markers. (QFIX_5)

Test 4
------
Close TestJava.java and then reopen in by selecting Open With > Java Editor.

Check for quick fixes as in test 1. Make sure the list of quick fixes is the same
