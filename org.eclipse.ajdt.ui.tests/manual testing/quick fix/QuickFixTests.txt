Quick Fix Tests (bug 71998)
===========================

Test 1
------
Checkout the QuickFix test project.

Open TestJava.java in the editor.

It should contain one warning and one error, with a light bulb gutter annotation
for each.

The code causing the warning and error should be underlined in red and yellow
respectively.

Test that suitable quick fixes are available for both the warning and the error by:
  - Right-click the gutter annotation and select "Quick Fix" from the context menu
  - Putting the cursor somewhere in the error/warning and pressing Ctrl-1
  - Clicking on the light bulb

  
Test 2
------
Repeat the above in the TestAspect.java file, but the results should be as follows:

  - light bulbs markers appears, but no completions are available.
  
Test 3
------
Repeat the above in the TestAspect2.aj file, but the results should be as follows:

  - no light bulbs are present, just the standard error and warning markers.

Test 4
------
Close TestJava.java and then reopen in by selecting Open With > Java Editor.

Check for quick fixes as in test 1. Make sure the list of quick fixes is the same
as before, and does not contain duplicates.
