Welcome pages testing
---------------------

(1) Show the welcome pages (Help > Welcome)

(2) for each of the four sections (Overview, samples, tutorial, whats new) follow
    all the links and check that they still make sense. (WELCOME_1)
    
NB - if the "what's new" link doesn't work, or doesn't reference the latest "New and Noteworthy"
then need to change link in org.eclipse.ajdt.ui/intro/ajdtNewsExtensionContext.xml
