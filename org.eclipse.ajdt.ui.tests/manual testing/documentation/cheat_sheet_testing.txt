The links in the cheat sheet need to be tested, as do the actions
-----------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Open up the cheat sheet (Help > Cheat Sheets > AspectJ > Hello World AspectJ Application)

(2) Click on all the "?" down the right hand side and check they link somewhere sensible

(3) Walk through the cheat sheat, choosing "Perform Action" rather than "skip" if at all
    possible.
    
    
PASS: All links should work, and all the action buttons should work.    (CHEAT_1)
