Workbench setup:

- Install AJDT 1.1.12: http://download.eclipse.org/technology/ajdt/30/update
- choose the defaults for the settings:
	Workbench settings: 
		- choose to make the AspectJ editor default for .java
		- disable analyzing of annotations while typing

setup for Builder migration page

- install "Spacewar Example"
	- ensure that Spacewar example is using project settings 
	  and has chosen to use incremental compilation
- download "Simple AJ Project" into workspace
	- ensure "Simple AJ Project" is using workspace settings
- intall "Tracing Example"
	- ensure that tracing example is using project settings 
    	  but has not chosen to use incremental compilation

- check that these projects have .ajsym and .generated.lst files
- check that aspects are contained in .java files
- right click on a class file and navigate to "open with". Check that
  the AspectJ/Java Editor is an option (and the default)

setup for PDE migration page

- download "migration.tests.plugin.project" into workspace
	- ensure that this has a dependency on "org.aspectj.ajde"

setup for workbench settings migration page

- turn off "analyse annotations whilst typing"
- unused imports

- create another workspace
- install "spacewar example" into this workspace
	- check that these projects have .ajsym and .generated.lst files
	- check that aspects are contained in .java files
	- right click on a class file and navigate to "open with". Check that
  	  the AspectJ/Java Editor is an option (and the default)

- Switch back to the original workspace

Test:

- Install AJDT 1.2.0
- When brought back up, the migration wizard will appear

Things to check
	- should no longer have AsepctJ/Java Editor associated with .java files
	- defaults - everything should change
	- if decide not to do something then that setting isn't changed


also need to test:

- chosen to remove builder from one project and not another
- chosen to change file extensions for one project and not another
- chosen to switch project dependencies from org.aspectj.ajde to 
  org.aspectj.runtime for one project and not another
