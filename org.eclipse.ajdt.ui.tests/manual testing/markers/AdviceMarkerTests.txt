Advised By Links (bug 76061)
---------------------------------
Install the Spacewar example.

Move the coordination package to an alternative folder in the file system 
outside the workspace e.g. C:\temp\spacewar

Create a linked folder that links to the folder above 'coordination'. (New >
Folder, then use the 'Advanced>>' button to link to a folder in the file 
system).

Convert the linked folder to a source folder (New > Source Folder, insert name
of folder you just created).

Rebuild and open Registry.aj from the spacewar package. Locate the dummy()
method that is being advised.  Right click on one of the advice markers,
click 'Advised by..', then click on one of the entries from Coordinator
in the sub-menu.  The file containing the advice, Coordinator.aj, should be opened
in the editor (at the location of the advice). (ADVICE_1)


Missing markers (bug 70658)
-------------------------------
Open a file in the editor that has some advice markers.  Close the outline view
then restart the workbench.  The advice markers should still be able to be
seen on the open file. (ADVICE_2)
