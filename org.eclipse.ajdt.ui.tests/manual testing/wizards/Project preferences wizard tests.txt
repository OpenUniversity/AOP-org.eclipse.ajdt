Tests for 73859 - changes in aspectpath etc. should cause a build if "build automatically" is selected
---------------

(1) Check out "Simple AJ Project" from org.eclipse.ajdt.test/test projects
(2) Check that "build automatically" is set (Project > build automatically)
(3) Change the settings on the following pages in various orders:

		- AspectJ 		
		- AspectJ Aspect Path    
		- AspectJ Compiler
		- AspectJ Inpath 

	and press "Apply" and "OK" in various orders.
	
	In particular, change the aspect path and compiler page at the same 
	time and then the compiler and inpath pages at the same time and 
	check that the expected behaviour is seen.
	
The following behaviour should be seen:

	(1) If a build occurs it should only happen once (per click of Apply 
		or Ok) no matter how many of the different settings you change
	(2) if the compiler settings have changed and you choose not to build 
		now then no build takes place
	(3) If, after several clicks, you revert all the settings to what 
	    they were before you started, then no build takes place
	(4) Pressing cancel means none of the changes are set       	
 
(4) Now choose not to build automatically and repeat the above tests. 
	The following behaviour should now be seen:
    
    (1) unless compiler settings are changed, no build happens
    (2) if the compiler settings are changed then there is a build 
    	depending on whether you choose to do one or not in the 
    	resulting question box. 
 
Test for 76811 - AJDT's preference pages do not behave like those of the JDT
--------------

(1) Check out "Simple AJ Project" from org.eclipse.ajdt.test/test projects
(2) Check that "build automatically" is set (Project > build automatically)


(a) The AspectJ page:

Switch to the AspectJ page and change the settings in various orders, by 
adding text and pressing "restore defaults", "cancel" and "OK".

The following behaviour should be seen:

	(1) restore defaults should not change the underlying settings so 
		pressing restore defaults --> cancel and then bringing up the 
		project properties again should see the previous settings still 
		visible
	(2) restore defaults should not force a build
	(3) The following is the default settings:
	
			- nothing in the outjar field
			- nothing in the extra compiler options field
			- use incremental should not be checked
			- create structure model should be checked
			- output weaving info should not be checked.	    
			
(b) The AspectJ Compiler page:

Switch to the AspectJ compiler page.

The following behaviour should be seen:

	(1) When "Workspace Settings" is checked, then you cant click the 
		tabs in the project settings
	(2) When project settings is checked, then you can click the tabs.  
	(3) Switching between using project and workbench settings as many 
		times as you like but finishing on the one you started with 
		(without making any other changes) should not prompt for a build.
	(4) Switching between using project and workbench settings as many 
		times as you like but finishing on the one you didn't start with 
		(without making any other changes) should prompt for a build.
	(5) if the preference page is brought up with project properties 
		being used and something within that has changed, then should 
		be always be prompted for a build (regardless of whether auto 
		building is set or not). If at this point you decide not to build, 
	    then no build occurs. If you decide to build now then a build 
	    always occurs. 
	(6) if the preference page is brought up with workspace properties 
		being used and the workbench settings are changed by clicking on 
		the "Change workbench settings" button, then you should be prompted 
		for a build for the wizard where you configure the workspace
	    settings, but not for the project properties wizard.
	(7) if you change the workbench settings and click "apply" then make 
		no other changes before clicking "ok" you should not be prompted 
		for a build.
	(8) Change something on the AspectJ page AND the compiler settings 
		page, then press "ok" should only be prompted for a build once.
	(9) Bringing up the preference page with "use workspace settings" 
		check, switching to using project settings, changing a couple 
		of the settings and then returning to using workspace settings 
		should not prompt for a build (if haven't changed workspace settings).
