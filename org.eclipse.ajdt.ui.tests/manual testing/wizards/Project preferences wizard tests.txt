Tests for 73859 - changes in aspectpath etc. should cause a build if "build automatically" is selected
---------------

(1) Check out "Simple AJ Project" from org.eclipse.ajdt.test/test projects
(2) Check that "build automatically" is set (Project > build automatically)
(3) Change the settings in various orders:

		- AspectJ - outjar setting
		- AspectJ Inpath
		- AspectJ Aspect Path    
		- AspectJ Compiler 

	and press "Apply" and "OK" in various orders.
	
The following behaviour should be seen:

	(1) If a build occurs it should only happen once (per click of Apply or Ok) no matter
	    how many of the different settings you change
	(2) if the compiler settings have changed and you choose not to build now then
        no build takes place
	(3) If, after several clicks, you revert all the settings to what they were 
        before you started, then no build takes place (this does not include the case
        when the compiler settings have been changed - even if they are reverted - this
        behaviour was there before)
	(4) Pressing cancel means none of the changes are set       	
 
(4) Now choose not to build automatically and repeat the above tests. The following behaviour 
    should now be seen:
    
    (1) unless compiler settings are changed, no build happens
    (2) if the compiler settings are changed then there is a build depending on whether you
        choose to do one or not in the resulting question box.
