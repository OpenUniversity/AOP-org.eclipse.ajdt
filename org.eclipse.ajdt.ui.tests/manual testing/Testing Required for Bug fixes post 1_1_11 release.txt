(excluding those covered by individual test documents)

	-	Visualiser/AJDT plugin didn't work in runtime workbench created from a 
workbench which had AJDT installed.
	-	Fix - stop the METADATA directory being created for the visualiser plugin by 
changing the build script to create jar files rather than zip files.
	-	Testing required = Setting off runtime workbench from workbench with 
AJDT installed and checking it works. Also, check that in workbench where 
AJDT is installed, that the AJDT related plugins can be imported as extenal 
plugins and fragments (this was caused by the same problem)

	-	When using AJDT with MyEclipse, the user will get an error when running his 
servlets unless he adds aspectjrt.jar to the classpath of his application server. 
Because this might not be obvious to every user, I have added a message 
box that appears whenever AspectJ nature gets added to a MyEclipse project 
and informs the user about that.
	-	Test: Install MyEclipse, install AJDT, create Web Module Project, add 
AspectJ nature. Does the message box appear? It should also appear only 
once per eclipse-startup.

	- In 1.1.11, there was no gutter annotation for advice from injars.
	- Test: Import the project "jarCreatingProject", set "output jar" in AspectJ
	  properties of to myJar.jar and build.
	  Import the project "jarDependentProject" and add "myJar.jar" to the "AspectJ 
	  Aspect Path", do a build. Then open "C.java" in editor. If the main
	  method has got an "advised by" icon in the gutter, everything is ok.
