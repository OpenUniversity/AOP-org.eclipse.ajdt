Testing Required for Bug fixes post 1.1.11 release
(excluding those covered by individual test documents)

-------------

	Visualiser/AJDT plugin didn't work in runtime workbench created from a 
	workbench which had AJDT installed.
FIX 	Stop the METADATA directory being created for the visualiser plugin by 
		changing the build script to create jar files rather than zip files.

TEST -  Set off runtime workbench from workbench with AJDT installed
	 -  Open the Spacewar project in the runtime  workbench and visualise
	 	It should visualise properly, i.e. show bars with rendered aspects
			(FIXES_1)
	 -  Also, check that in workbench where AJDT is installed, that the AJDT
	 	related plugins can be imported as extenal plugins and fragments
	 	(this was caused by the same problem)
			(FIXES_2)

--------------

	When using AJDT with MyEclipse, the user will get an error when running his 
	servlets unless he adds aspectjrt.jar to the classpath of his application server.
	Because this might not be obvious to every user, I have added a message 
	box that appears whenever AspectJ nature gets added to a MyEclipse project 
	and informs the user about that.
TEST	Install MyEclipse, install AJDT, create Web Module Project, add 
		AspectJ nature. Does the message box appear? It should also appear only 
		once per eclipse-startup.

	In 1.1.11, there was no gutter annotation for advice from injars.
TEST	Import the project "jarCreatingProject", set "output jar" in AspectJ
		properties of to myJar.jar and build.
		Import the project "jarDependentProject" and add "myJar.jar" to the "AspectJ
		Aspect Path", do a build. Then open "C.java" in editor. If the main
		method has got an "advised by" icon in the gutter, everything is ok.
