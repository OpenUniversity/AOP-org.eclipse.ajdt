Refactoring Tests
---------------------

1. Rename file extensions for individual files

 a.	Right click on a .java file in one of your AspectJ projects and then click
    “Convert file extension to .aj”.  Check that the file extension changes
    correctly. (REF_1)
 b.	Right click on a .aj file in one of your AspectJ projects and then click
    “Convert file extension to .java”.  Check that the extension changes correctly.
    (REF_2)

2. Rename file extensions for multiple files

 a.	Right click on two or more .java files in one of your AspectJ projects and
    then click “Convert file extension to .aj”.  Check that the file extensions
    change correctly. (REF_3)
 b.	Right click on two or more .aj file in one of your AspectJ projects and then
    click “Convert file extension to .java”.  Check that the extensions change
    correctly. (REF_4)
 c.	Right click on a selection of two or more files with different extensions and
    ensure that you see neither of the above actions in the menu. (REF_5)

3. Rename excluded files

 a.	Right click on a couple of files and click “Exclude from ‘…’ configuration”.
 b.	Open the active configuration in the editor and ensure that the files are
    listed individually in the exclude list (on the source tab).
 c.	Right click on the selection again and convert the file extensions.  Ensure
    that the build configuration updates correctly.  Repeat to change the
    extensions back and ensure that the configuration updates correctly again.
    (REF_6)

4. Rename file extensions for a whole project.

 a.	Right click on one of your AspectJ projects, then click “Convert file
    extensions…”.  
 b.	Select “Convert all extensions to .java” and click ‘OK’.  Ensure that all
    source files in that project have their extensions changed correctly. (REF_7)
 c.	Repeat step a, then select “Convert all extensions to .aj” and click ‘OK’. 
    Ensure that all source files in that project have their extensions changed
    correctly. (REF_8)
 d.	Exclude some of your files from the build configuration.  (Right click on some
    of the files and click ‘Exclude from current build configuration).  Repeat steps
    a-c both with the “Include files not included in the active build
    configuration” checkbox checked.  Ensure that all files are renamed as expected
    and the build configurations update correctly. (REF_9)
 e.	Repeat step d with the “Include files not included in the active build
    configuration” checkbox unchecked.  Ensure that all files are renamed as
    expected. (REF_10)
 f.	Repeat step d with the “Update all build configurations” checkbox unchecked.
    Ensure that the build configurations do not change. (REF_11)
  
5. bug 92482: Rename of .aj file fails in package explorer

 a. Install the Bean Example
 b. Expand the Bean Example in the package explorer
 c. Right click on "BoundPoint.aj" to bring up the context menu
 d. Select "Rename..." which apppears under "Refactor" (not the rename
    in the "Refactor > Rename..." menu)
 e. A "Rename Resource" dialog appears (REF_12)
 f. Choose to rename BoundPoint.aj to BoundPoint1.aj.
 g. Click "OK"
 h. The file should be renamed correctly (REF_13)
    
NOTE: this is not a clever rename - it just renames the file. It doesn't
      rename any references etc. and if the file is excluded from the
      active build configuration then the .ajproperties file isn't 
      updated correctly. Moreover, the type isn't updated.
