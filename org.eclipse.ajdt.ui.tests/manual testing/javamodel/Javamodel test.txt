1. If a .aj file contains correct AspectJ code, is in an AspectJ project and on
the classpath, then it should be possible to expand it to see its children
in the package explorer view. (MODEL_1)

2. Does the .aj file filter work? 
The .aj file filter should be on by default and hide the IResource version
of .aj files in the package explorer view if an ICompilationUnit version
exists -> no duplicates of .aj files visible. (MODEL_2)
Special case to test:
Before having installed AJDT: enable/disable some random filters in package
explorer (makes it save the preferences). Then install AJDT. You should
now get a dialog telling you that you should enable the .aj file filter. (MODEL_3)
