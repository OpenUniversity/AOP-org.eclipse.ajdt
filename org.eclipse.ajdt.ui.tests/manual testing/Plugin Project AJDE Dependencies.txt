Test Of Plug-in Project Behavior When Being Converted To aspectJ Projects

Bug 72007

1. Install new copies of eclipse and ajdt and check out "Hello World Plugin" 
from "org.eclipse.ajdt.tests/test projects" on the Eclipse CVS repository. 
Launch a runtime workbench and click ‘Sample Menu’ > ‘Sample Action’ to verify the 
plugin is working. You should see a dialog box containing the text “Hello Eclipse 
and Hello from AspectJ”.

2. Switch to the java perspective and open "Hello World Plugin" and then open its 
plugin.xml file. Click the dependencies tab which is found at the bottom of the new
window. And in the "Required Plugin-ins" section should be the plugins:
org.eclipse.ui, org.eclipse.core.runtime and org.aspectj.ajde.

3. Right click the project and select "Remove AspectJ Nature" and check that the 
required plugin org.aspectj.ajde has disapeared.

4. Now click "Add..." to the right of the "Required Plug-ins" box and add 
"org.aspectj.ajde" then save the file. Now right click the "Hello World Plugin" 
project and select "Convert to AspectJ Project". Check that the "Required plug-ins" 
section still only contains a single entry for "org.aspectj.ajde".

4. Right click the "Hello World Plugin" project and then select "Remove AspectJ Nature".
There should still be a single entry in the "Required plug-ins" section for 
"org.aspectj.ajde"

5. Right click the "org.aspectj.ajde" plug-in and select "Delete". Ensure the file is 
saved and now convert the "Hello World Plugin" project to aspectj as before, and 
this should present you with a dialog box which you should reply "Yes" to. This should
then add the "org.aspectj.ajde" plugin to the dependencies found in the 
"Required Plug-ins" box.
