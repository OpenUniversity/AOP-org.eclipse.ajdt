Tests included in this file:

(1) Test to ensure not constantly rebuilding (bug 74174)
(2) Test to ensure don't rebuild if src file changes which isn't in active build config file
(3) Test for bug 48518 - if contents of jar file changes, then want to force a

Test to ensure not constantly rebuilding (bug 74174)
----------------------------------------------------

(1) Check out: 
    	
    	- org.eclipse.contribution.visualiser
   
    from dev.eclipse.org
    
(2) If it's not already, convert org.eclipse.contribution.visualiser to be an AJ project by
    right clicking and selecting "Convert to AspectJ Project"
    
(3) createa new text file in org.eclipse.contribution.visualiser

		- highlight org.eclipse.contribution.visualiser
		- right click
		- select "New > File"
		- enter "test.txt" in the name
		- click Finish
		
(4) The org.eclipse.contribution.visualiser project should NOT rebuild. (BUILD_1)

		- the last entry in the AspectJ Event Trace should be
		
		  build: Examined delta - no source file changes for project org.eclipse.contribution.visualiser  
		  


Test to ensure don't rebuild if src file changes which isn't in active build config file
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Import the AspectJ Bean Example into your workspace
(2) Create a DummyClass in the bean package (File > New > Class)
(3) Exclude DummyClass from the active build configuration (right click and choose
    "exclude from build configuration"
(4) Add the following method to DummyClass:

		public dummyMethod() {
		}
		
(5) Save DummyClass and no build should occur - so there should be no error
    warnings about the syntax. (BUILD_2)
		    
(6) Create a DummyAspect in the bean package (File > New > Aspect)
(7) Exclude DummyAspect from the active build configuration (right click and choose
    "exclude from build configuration"
(8) Add the following badly formed pointcut to DummyAspect:

		pointcut.....
		
(9) Save DummyAspect and no build should occur - so there should be no error warnings
    about the syntax. (BUILD_3)


		  		   
Test for bug 74401 - External jars on inpath not found
------------------------------------------------------

(1) Check out bug74401 test project

(2) Right click > Project projects > AspectJ Inpath

(3) Set hello.jar as a (workspace) JAR

(4) Rebuild project and check it builds okay (BUILD_4)

(5) Right click > Project projects > AspectJ Inpath

(6) Remove jar file and add it again this time as an external JAR file

(7) Rebuild project and check it builds okay (BUILD_5)

(8) Right click > Project projects > AspectJ Inpath

(9) Remove jar file, Add Variable... > Configure Variable... > New...

(1) Check out "Simple AJ Project"
(2) Turn off "build automatically" (Project > Build automatically)
(3) add the following to p1/Main.java:

	twtretwer
	
(4) Save the file and Build the project by pressing the build button
(5) There should be a compiler error in the problem view
test...
(6) remove the error you inserted in step (3)
(7) Save the file
(8) Clean the project Project > Clean > Clean selected project
