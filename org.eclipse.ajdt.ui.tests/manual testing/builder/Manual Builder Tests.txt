(1) Test to ensure not constantly rebuilding (bug 74174)
(2) Test for bug 48518 - if contents of jar file changes, then want to force a 
    build for dependent projects




Test to ensure not constantly rebuilding (bug 74174)
----------------------------------------------------

(1) in a runtime workbench either use an existing AspectJ project, or check out 
    	
    	- org.eclipse.contribution.visualiser
    	- org.aspectj.runtime
   
    from dev.eclipse.org
    
(2) convert org.eclipse.contribution.visualiser to be an AJ project by right 
    clicking and selecting "Convert to AspectJ Project"
    
(3) create a new text file in org.eclipse.contribution.visualiser

		- highlight org.eclipse.contribution.visualiser
		- right click
		- select "New > File"
		- enter "test.txt" in the name
		- click Finish
		
(4) The org.eclipse.contribution.visualiser project should NOT rebuild.

		- check the progress monitor in the bottom right hand corner of
		  your workbench - nothing should be there
		- check the progress view (Window > Show View > Basic > Progress)- nothing
		  should be there - no builds
		  
If any builds are being triggered then this test fails.		    


		  		   
Test for bug 48518 - if contents of jar file changes, then force a build for dependent projects
------------------

(1) Check out jarCreatingProject and jarDependentProject from:

		dev.eclipse.org/org.eclipse.ajdt/.../org.eclipse.ajdt.test/test projects
		
(2) Check that jarDependentProject has a project dependency on jarCreatingProject:

		- right click on jarDependentProject
		- navigate to "properties"
		- highlight "Java Build path" 
		- navigate to the projects tab
		- ensure the box next to "jarCreatingProject" is checked
		- click ok
		
(3) Check that jarCreatingProject is sending its output to a jar file called myJar.jar

		- right click on jarCreatingProject
		- navigate to "properties"
		- highlight "AspectJ" 
		- ensure the box next to "Outjar" contains "myJar.jar"
		- click ok
		
(4)	Build both projects - both should build with no errors - and check that "build automatically"
    is selected (Project > Build Automatically)

(up until now has been setup.....)

(5) bring up abstract aspect A.aj in the editor (this is in jarCreatingProject)

(6) add the following abstract pointcut to the aspect:

    	public abstract pointcut another();	
    	
(7) save A.aj - this forces a build

(8) RESULT: jarDependingProject should now be marked with errors due to 
    problems in Concrete.aj. In the problems view, there is the following
    message:
    
    "Inherited abstract pointcut p1.A.another() is not made concrete in Concrete"
    
    Looking in the AJDT Event Trace (Window > Show View > AspectJ > AJDT Event Trace), it
    should contain messages like the following:
    
    13:29:59	 build: Kind=AUTOBUILD Project=jarDependentProject Mode=Full AspectJ compilation
	13:29:59	 build: Examined delta - no source file changes for project jarDependentProject
	13:29:59	 build: Examined delta - source file changes in required project jarDependentProject
    
(9) Comment out the abstract pointcut you've just inserted:

		// public abstract pointcut another();	
		
(10) save A.aj - this forces a build

(11) RESULT: there should be no build errors on jarCreatingProject and jarDependingProject		
    
(12) Create a text file in jarCreatingProject:

		- right click on jarCreatingProject
		- Select New > File
		- Enter name test.txt
		- click "OK"
		
(13) The AJDT event trace should contain something like the following:

	13:36:22	 build: Kind=AUTOBUILD Project=jarCreatingProject Mode=Full AspectJ compilation
	13:36:22	 build: Examined delta - no source file changes for project jarCreatingProject
	13:36:22	 build: Kind=AUTOBUILD Project=jarDependentProject Mode=Full AspectJ compilation
	13:36:22	 build: Examined delta - no source file changes for project jarDependentProject
	
	and consequently a rebuild of jarDependingProject should not occur.
