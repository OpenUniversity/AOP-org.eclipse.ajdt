Test that preference wizard occurs if have empty workspace and check out from CVS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Create a brand new empty workspace

(2) Check out "Simple AJ Project" and "Tracing Aspect Project" from the test projects
    folder in org.eclipse.ajdt.test at the same time:
    
    	- go to the CVS Repository Perspective
    	- expand the tree until you can see "Simple AJ Project" and "Tracing Aspect Project"
    	- highlight "Simple AJ Project" and "Tracing Aspect Project" by clicking on them
    	  and pressing the shift key
    	- right click and select "Check out"

(3) Wait for them to check out and build (without touching Eclipse in the mean time)

(4) When everything has finished notice that there is the AJDT Configuration Preference Wizard
    showing (this probably popped up in the middle of the build, but leave it until the build
    has finished)
    
(5) Click "Finish" on the AJDT Configuration Preference Wizard.

(6) The wizard should disappear.

This test fails if you have to click "Finish" on the AJDT Configuration Preference Wizard twice,
as this means that one wizard has been created for each AJ project checked out, rather than
one wizard per checkout (if the preferences haven't already been set).  (CVS_1)
