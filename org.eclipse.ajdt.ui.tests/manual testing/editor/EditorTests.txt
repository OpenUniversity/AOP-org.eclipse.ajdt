Editor Manual Tests

1. Syntax Highlighting (bug 62265)
AspectJ keywords do not get highlighted any 
more if there is a dot '.' in front of them. (EDITOR_1)

a.	Install AJDT and open a .aj file.  
b.	Check that “before” gets highlighted, but not “.before”
c.	Repeat for “get” and “.get”
d.	Check that “.static” is still highlighted
e.	Do the same check in a .java file (when opened in the AspectJ Editor) 
    NB ignore red squiggles as this is a known limitation


2. Editor Ruler context menu (EDITOR_2)

a. Open a file with the AspectJ editor, and open another beside it with the java editor.
b. Right click on the ruler in both files and ensure that the menus match. 
c. Test all of the actions in the AspectJ editor to ensure they perform as expected.
