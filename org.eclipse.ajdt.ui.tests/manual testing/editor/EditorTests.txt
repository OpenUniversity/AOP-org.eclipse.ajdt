Editor Manual Tests

1. Syntax Highlighting (bug 62265)
AspectJ keywords do not get highlighted any 
more if there is a dot '.' in front of them. (EDITOR_1)

a.	Install AJDT and open a .aj file.  
b.	Check that “before” gets highlighted, but not “.before”
c.	Repeat for “get” and “.get”
d.	Check that “.static” is still highlighted
e.	Do the same check in a .java file (when opened in the AspectJ Editor) 
    NB ignore red squiggles as this is a known limitation


2. Editor Ruler context menu (EDITOR_2)

a. Open a file with the AspectJ editor, and open another beside it with the java editor.
b. Right click on the ruler in both files and ensure that the menus match. 
c. Test all of the actions in the AspectJ editor to ensure they perform as expected.

  entries
  					(EDITOR_3)

					(EDITOR_5)
- shutdown the inplace view (via pressing escape or clicking
  the editor outside of the view)

  in tests 4 and 5 (provided you didn't set it to be too small)
					(EDITOR_6)

  inplace view
- uncheck "remember size and loation"

					(EDITOR_7) 	
- click the blue arrow in the top right hand corner of the
  inplace view
- ensure that "remember size and location" is ticked
- click move and move the inplace view
- click resize and resize the inplace view (make it larger rather
  than smaller to ensure you don't hit the minimum size)

- open Bullet.java in the Java Editor
- open the inplace outline view 
- the view should be in the same position and have the same
  size as you have just set.
