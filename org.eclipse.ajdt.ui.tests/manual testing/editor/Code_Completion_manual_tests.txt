Tests included in this file:

For Luzius' history of code completion, details of the current implementation, 
and its limitations see: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=74419

Areas to cover:

- from within a method (CC_1)
- outside any methods (CC_2)
- from within advice - before, after, around (CC_3)
- from within an intertype declaration  (CC_4)        <------ is likely to be the most problematic

different situations:

- in a .java (CC_5)
- in a .aj file (1-4 assumed to be done in a .aj file)
- in an aspect which extends an abstract aspect (CC_6)

Auto activation
----------------

Install the Spacewar Example and open Coordinator.  In one of the methods
or constructor type "exclusions.".  Possible completions should appear. (CC_7)

Switch off auto-activation by clicking 'Window' > 'Preferences' > 'Java'
> 'Editor' > 'Code Assist' and unchecking 'Enable Auto Activation'.  Type
"exclusions." again in the editor and the completions should not appear (CC_8)

Switch auto-activation back on and check that it works as in CC_7 (CC_9)

Bug 129367: Mad code completion makes it impossible to enter pointcuts!
-----------

Create a new aspect, and start typing the following (line breaks are *significant*):

	pointcut callToJdbc() :
		call(* java.
		
Now pause, and check that NO content-assist proposals are given, and that
NO completions are auto-inserted into the buffer. (CC_10)
