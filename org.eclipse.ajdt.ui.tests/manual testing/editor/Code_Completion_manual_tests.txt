For Luzius' history of code completion, details of the current implementation, 
and its limitations see: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=74419

Areas to cover:

- from within a method (CC_1)
- outside any methods (CC_2)
- from within advice - before, after, around (CC_3)
- from within an intertype declaration  (CC_4)        <------ is likely to be the most problematic
