Tests contained in this file:

In an aspect which contains a pointcut with a "." in it:

(1) organize imports when there's nothing to add or remove 
(2) removing an unused import
(3) adding a required import

In an aspect which extends an abstract aspect and which has more than one variable.

(4) Organize imports when there's nothing to add or remove (where there are two variables)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the Bean Example:

Setup required for all of the following tests:
	
	- File > New > Other > AspectJ > AspectJ Examples > Bean Example
	- Click "next"
	- Click "Finish"
	- Open BoundPoint.aj in the editor
	- ensure that autobuilding is enabled (Window > Build Automatically)

These tests are specifically using BoundPoing.aj because there's a "." in 
the pointcut body - this was causing problems.

(1) Organize imports when there's nothing to add or remove

	(a) click anywhere in the main body of BoundPoint.aj
	(b) select "Ctrl + Shift + O"
	(c) nothing should happen (other than the java.bean.* import being optionally expanded)
	    In particular, there should be no dilog which
	    appear with the title "Organize Imports" and the message:

			Compilation unit has parse errors: 'Syntax error on token "$", 
			delete this token'. No changes applied.   (IMPORTS_1)
	(d) there should be a message in the bottom left hand corner of Eclipse 
	    saying "0 import(s) added", or "1 import(s) added" if expansion of
	    java.bean.* took place
   	(e) Save the file and there should be no build errors  (IMPORTS_2)

(2) Removing an unused import

	(a) add the following to the import list at the top of BoundPoint.aj:
	
		import java.io.File;
		
	(b)	after the build, a warning appears next to the import statement you
	    have just entered.	   
	(c) click anywhere in the main body of BoundPoint.aj and select "Ctrl + Shift + O".
	(d) "import java.io.File;" should no longer be in the import list and there
	    should be a message in the bottom left hand corner of Eclipse, that one
	    import was removed. (IMPORTS_3)     
	(e) Save the file and there should be no build errors  (IMPORTS_4)
		    
(3) Adding a required import

	(a) change the pointcut:
	
	    pointcut setter(Point p): call(void Point.set*(*)) && target(p);
	  	   
	  	to read:
	  	
	  	pointcut setter(Point p): call(void Point.set*(*)) && call(* File.*(..)) && target(p);

	(c) click anywhere in the main body of BoundPoint.aj and select "Ctrl + Shift + O".
	(d) "import java.io.File;" should now be in the import list and there
	    should be a message in the bottom left hand corner of Eclipse, that one
	    import was added.  (IMPORTS_5)    
	(e) Save the file and there should be no build errors  	 (IMPORTS_6)
	 
Using the Spacewar example:

	- File > New > Other > AspectJ > AspectJ Examples > Spacewar Example
	- Click "next"
	- Click "Finish"
	- Open Gamesynchronization.aj in the editor
	- ensure that autobuilding is enabled (Window > Build Automatically)
 	   	
(4) Organize imports when there's nothing to add or remove (where there are two variables)

	(a) click anywhere in the main body of Gamesynchronization.aj
	(b) select "Ctrl + Shift + O"
	(c) nothing should happen. In particular, there should be no dialog which
	    appear with the title "Organize Imports" and the message:

			Compilation unit has parse errors: 'Syntax error on token "$", 
			delete this token'. No changes applied.   (IMPORTS_7)
	(d) there should be a message in the bottom left hand corner of Eclipse 
	    saying "0 import(s) added"	
	(e) Save the file and there should be no build errors     (IMPORTS_8)
