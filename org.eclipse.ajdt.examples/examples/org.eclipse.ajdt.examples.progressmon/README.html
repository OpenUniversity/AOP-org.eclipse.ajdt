<h2>AspectJ Plug-in Example: Progress Monitor Checker</h2>
 
<p>
  This example plug-in project contains an aspect (in ProgressChecker.aj)
  which checks for proper usage of the Eclipse IProgressMonitor
  interface, as dicussed in the following Eclipse Corner article:
</p>

<p><i><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Progress-Monitors/article.html">
How to Correctly and Uniformly Use Progress Monitors</a></i> 
</p>

<p>
  The plug-in includes some JUnit tests (in ProgressCheckerTest.java) which show the
  cases which are detected by the aspect, along with examples of the reports issued.
</p>

<p>
  To export the progress monitor checker as a plugin, you can use Export -> Plug-In Development -> 
  Deployable Plug-Ins and Fragments.  This performs a PDE build of the plug-in.
  You can configure the PDE build through the build.properties file included in this project.
